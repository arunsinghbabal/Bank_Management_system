# Bank_Management_system
This is a Bank Management System Database Project.

# Abstract: 
The main aim of Bank Management Mini project is to keep record of customer transactions in the bank. We aim to demonstrate the use of create, read, update and delete MySQL operations through this project. Firstly, customer registration is done in the concern bank branch. The customer can login into his or her bank account and update the personal details. They are also authorized to print or download a bank statement containing the details of credit and debit transactions with datetime stamp. Only a branch employee can credit amount and debit amount in any account and can perform the account closure procedure.<br />
